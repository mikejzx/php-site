php-site
========

This is a bit of test site written for my own learning purposes. The term
'forum' may appear in the source code since that was one of the original ideas
for the project, however I'm not sure if you could call it that just yet.

The code might be a little bit of a mess, but in general this is basically a
site with a login/register system and not much else. Here are some of the
features implemented:

* Login page
* Register page - users require a PGP key to sign up.
* Argon2 password hashing (with salt and a pepper)
* Confirmation system - users in database are marked 'Unverified' if not
  confirmed via e-mail.
* Confirmation e-mail - is also encrypted via PGP
* A simple account management page, to re-send confirmation e-mail, and to
  delete account.

Usage:
If you'd like to try running this site for whatever reason, be sure to create a
config.php file. An example, 'config.php.example' is provided. Ensure you also
read the following text to get it running:

Requirements to run:
* A web server, e.g Nginx, with functional PHP
* GnuPG extension for PHP
* PHPMailer (with PGP support patch) - provided in the source code in /vendor.
  (See https://github.com/mikejzx/php-mailer-pgp for more info.)
* MySQL database software, e.g MariaDB

MySQL:
The site use a MySQL database to store user information. Database should be
laid out in the following manner. The VARCHAR sizes and other attributes are
provided as a guide.

+ Table: 'Users'
  Columns:
  + email: VARCHAR(32), primary key 
         - user's e-mail address
  + username: VARCHAR(32)
            - user's username
  + pw_hash: VARCHAR(255)
           - user's hashed password
  + pgp_key_fp: VARCHAR(64) 
              - user's PGP key fingerprint
  + status: VARCHAR(12)
          - user's status on forum.
	  - E.g: 'Unverified', 'User', or 'Admin'
  + reg_date: TIMESTAMP
            - time at which user registered.
	    - Set default to current_timestamp()

+ Table: 'ConfirmationCodes'
  This is A table of users who are pending confirmation.
  Columns:
  + email: VARCHAR(32), primary key
         - e-mail address of this user
  + confirm_code: VARCHAR(64)
                - User's confirmation code (SHA256 hash)



Warning:
This site is almost certainly vulnerable to SQL injections on some pages in
it's current state. I may eventually get around to securing the code, but as of
now, I believe it's quite insecure.

php-mailer-pgp
==============

About:
This is a fork of PHPMailer, with a re-write of ravisorg's PGP encryption
implementation. I've re-written it to strip out all the stuff that I felt was
unnecessary and that was just complicating things. This version supports *only
encryption*. Signing is not implemented currently, however may be done so in
future. The idea was to just keep this class as simple as possible to suit my
use case. 

I didn't bother re-writing the comments so if you want some documentation just
compare it to the original code. I felt like the comments were a bit verbose
anyway.

ravisorg's original code:
https://github.com/ravisorg/PHPMailer/blob/openpgp/class.phpmailerpgp.php

Usage:
Clone this repo into your source directory and include the following in your
code (adjust the require-paths as necessary):

```
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailerPGP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;

require 'php-mailer-pgp/Exception.php';
require 'php-mailer-pgp/PHPMailer.php';
require 'php-mailer-pgp/PHPMailerPGP.php';
require 'php-mailer-pgp/SMTP.php';

// And then we can initialise the mailer like so
$mail = new PHPMailerPGP();
// ... put your usual configuration here.
// Encryption options:
$mail->setGPGHome("/path/to/.gnupg");
$mail->autoAddRecipients(false);
$mail->addRecipient($to, $keyfp);
$mail->encrypt();

// And we send
$mail->send();
```

The code:
It probably doesn't adhere to PHPMailer's styling conventions, and I pretty
much haven't documented the code at all, so I probably won't be pushing this
upstream, unless somebody sees it and thinks that it's actually worthy of being
pushed.
